Payout Automation System for EdTech Mentors
Scenario
As EdTech platforms scale, they rely on hundreds of mentors, instructors, and evaluators working across different time zones and formats ‚Äî live sessions, recorded reviews, evaluations, etc. Tracking and disbursing accurate payouts becomes a nightmare: multiple session types, varying rates, tax considerations, and poor communication make things inefficient and non-transparent.
Your challenge is to build ‚Äî a secure, flexible, and auditable payout automation platform that streamlines how EdTech companies manage payments to mentors and educators.
Objective
Create a system where the EdTech admin can:
* Collect session data linked to mentors
* Automate calculation of payouts with custom rate breakdowns
* Generate structured receipts including taxes and charges
* Share receipts with mentors instantly
* Communicate with mentors securely
* View historical audit logs and payout records
Mentors should:
* View their session history and payout breakdown
* Access downloadable receipts
* Chat with the organization for clarifications
User Roles
1. Admin (EdTech Organization)
   * Add session/payout data
   * Define breakdown logic and taxes
   * Generate & send receipts
   * Chat with mentors
   * View audit trail
2. Mentor (Contributor)
   * View payout dashboard
   * Download receipts
   * Chat with admin
   * Track payment status
Core Functional Modules
1. Session Data Collection & Breakdown Logic
* Admin can enter mentor session data (manual or CSV upload)
   * Fields: Mentor name, session date/time, session type, duration, rate/hour
* Smart breakdown: e.g., ‚Çπ4000/hour rate is auto-divided into custom slots (‚Çπ2000 for 30 mins, etc.)
* Filter sessions by date range (last 7, 15, 30 days or custom)
* Calculate cumulative payout within selected range
2. Automated Payout Calculation & Tax Handling
* Apply platform fee, GST, or custom charges
* Support deductions (if applicable)
* Final amount payable should be clear and transparent
* Allow manual overrides if needed (with logging)
3. Receipt Generation & Sharing
* Generate structured receipts per mentor:
   * Task list with time and rate
   * Tax/charge breakdown
   * Final payout amount
* Add a custom message
* One-click send via email to mentor
4. Mentor Dashboard
* View session and payout history
* Filter by date ranges
* Download receipts
* Track payment status (Pending, Paid, Under Review)
5. Secure Chat Between Admin and Mentor
* One-to-one encrypted chat
* Useful for clarifying payout doubts
* Shows timestamped communication logs
6. Audit Logs & Modification History
* Every change to payout data or receipt must be logged:
   * What changed, who changed it, and when
* Admin can view historical modifications for transparency
7. Test Mode / Simulation
* Admin can run a ‚Äúdry run‚Äù to preview payouts before sending
* Useful for reviewing payout structures before confirmation
8. Optional: Data Export & Integration Hooks
* Export payout summaries as CSV for accounting
* Optional webhook trigger when payouts are finalized
üõ†Ô∏è Bonus Complexity (Optional for Bonus Points)
* Support multiple session types (Live, Evaluation, Recording Review)
* Add mentor-level rate overrides (e.g., ‚Çπ4000/hr for Mentor A, ‚Çπ3000/hr for Mentor B)
* Allow mentors to submit payout disputes or correction requests
